notes:

1. appscrpit.js is for apps script, copy the code and put it on apps script.
2. if you came here from the video, i suggest you watch the part where i talked about the drive section.
3. outputs might not be the same for every id card, so take that with a grain of salt.
4. on "apps script api here", paste your apps script api.
5. you can do whatever you want with it, have fun :)
